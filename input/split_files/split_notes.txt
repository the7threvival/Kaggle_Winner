This file shall contain information on the various split files
available. Mainly why are there different ones and what they
each mean.

_challenge : those are one of the original split files. 
             tested and known to give good results with the original
             kaggle data. Kept as a reference.


_flukes10 : first try at splitting the data. Some refining was done and
          these contain our research fluke data separated so as to do
          introductory testing. We are using a minimum number of occurences
          of 10 as a start to make sure the network has plenty of data to 
          train and learn from. This also makes sure that all images found
          in the validation set are also in the training set as this 
          initial stage does not allow for new_whale recognition. 
          
          That shall be the next hopeful step when the model and training
          can show good learning and then next step after that will be
          to not only recognize new_whale upon their first occurence,
          but assign an ID to that new_whale and be able to recognize
          it again upon resurfacing, not as a new_whale but as a previously 
          seen one.

_flukes5 : Same as _flukes10 but with min # of occurences of 5.    

_flukes2 : Same as _flukes10 but with min # of occurences of 2. Can't be 1
          as that would mean 'new_whale' IDs are included (not there yet).
          This is just to see improvements in the algorithm and possibilities. 
          
_flukes2_90 : same as _flukes2 but with 90/10 train/valid split instead of 80/20. 


_new_flukes : with 90/10 train/valid split continued, this split fold uses the 
              newly sent data from Jason Parham. This has a bit more images and
              also contains bounding box information. The earlier ones were 
              already cropped. 

_new_flukes5 : same as _new_flukes but with min # of occurences at 5.

_new_flukes3 : same as _new_flukes but with min # of occurences at 3.

_newWhale5 : 'new_whale' class is included for the first time. This still uses the 
            newest data but all images with IDs that only appeared once were marked
            as 'new_whale'. And so that became a new class with the most occurences.
            Let's see how the network handles this. This has only IDs with min # of
            occurences at 5. 
            
            As a conclusion then, occurence of 1 can only ever mean that it's a 
            'new_whale'.
